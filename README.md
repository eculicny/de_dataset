# Data Engineering Interview Dataset 

## Background
At Vivante, we routinely leverage DBT to transform our data for a variety of reporting and modeling use cases. Hopefully this exercise will be representative of collaboration together on a normal work day. 

## The Dataset
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) routinely conducts a study to assess the health of adults and children living in the United States - the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

The NHANES consists of two components, a self-report interview and a physical examination. 

This exercise utilizes a subset of variables from the publicly available 2013-2014 NHANES dataset, encompassing four distinct
domains:
   1. Demographics
   2. Dietary Habits
   3. Physical Examination/Laboratory Test Results
   4. Healthcare Utilization

NOTE: Metadata can be found in data/metadata_nhanes.csv.
